# Credit-Card-Validator-in-Python-



This Problem is solved using Luhn's Algorithm :- 

Steps involved in Solving this problem are as follows :- 

Step 1. Double every second digit from left to right at the Odd Indexes . If doubling of a digit results in a
two-digit number, add up the two digits to get a single-digit number (like for 12:1+2, 18=1+8).

Step 2. Now add all single-digit numbers from Step 1.


Step 3. Add all digits in the even from left  to right  in the card number.


Step 4. Sum the results from Step 2 and Step 3.


Step 5. If the result from Step 4 is divisible by 10, the card number is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
